# Barplot-via-ggplot
This code plots a barplot in R. It loads ggplot2, and calculates the frequency of two categorical variables to plot. `xname` will be the main variable to be plotted. `fillname` will be the variable to segment by. The default is `prop = FALSE`, indicating proportions will not be plotted. Marginal proportions are not offered here.
